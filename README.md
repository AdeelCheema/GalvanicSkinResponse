# Galvanic Skin Response (For use with Arduino)

This code is meant to power a microcontroller-powered device which attaches to the skin and reports back a stream of data, polled at 40-400ms, and uses it to assess the stress level of its wearer.  After a brief calibration cycle at startup, it recognizes when you go under stress and it beeps and vibrates with rhythm accelerating as the user’s stress level increases, but slowly decreasing as the user’s stress level decreases.

Essentially, The device is meant to be miniaturized and worn under the clothes.  Especially powerful for anger and stress management, the wearer might be just ready to go off on someone, but the annoying beeps and vibrating SHOULD remind them to take a step back and calm down.  And the beeping slows down and relaxes as they do.
